I wondered why McIllvanney had not told me that Rickie and Robin-Anne Crowninshield were drug addicts then I realised that McIllvanney would not have told me anything that might have risked my acceptance of the charter but now that I had learned that the twins had such a severe drug problem I was even less keen to take on the job.\nAnd the hypothesis: Rickie and Robin-Anne Crowninshield were drug addicts\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: The hypothesis does not entail that the senator was speaking with venom.\n\nPrompt 1: \nGiven the premise: ``It doesn't happen very often.''

If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,.

So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet.

If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,.

It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now.

Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess.

This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,.

He brought me flowers, took me out to dinner and the theatre, and was generally attentive to me, as if I were his mistress and not an old married woman. If at any point I thought that his solicitude was the sort of tender kindness you might show to someone utterly dependent and helpless - a prisoner or a caged bird - I was ashamed at once and re-doubled my efforts to be a good wife asking Nonni to teach me how to cook the elaborate dishes Richard liked and taking care to change my dress before he came home in the evening.\nAnd the hypothesis: Richard's solicitude was the sort of tender kindness you might show to someone utterly dependent and helpless\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: It does not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper.

B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.

I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked.

It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, or current, B: Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before.

So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet.

He had but to comment favourably on the kittenish qualities of Babs Osborne for her to curl up as best she could on the plush seat beside him, her thumb in her mouth.

Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind.

Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet.

So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, or current, B: Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Polly had to think quickly.

I parked Armstrong on the road and walked down the short drive to the impressive Gothic porch around the front door.

No, it's too easy to forget that something which I hardly ever think about now was then a very great concern.

Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Gloria remarked as they shared their coffee break in the kitchen.

She had hoped to dodge the subject but might have known that Gloria's boundless interest in all things morbid and sensational would make it impossible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gloria's boundless interest in all things morbid and sensational would make dodging the subject impossible\nentailment\nGiven the premise: David had obviously always known and Julia had learned that, whatever feelings were churning around inside his mother's mind, it was vital for her that they remained private. David was holding the strings in a pattern Julia had never seen before. His face seemed to show nothing except benevolent interest but Julia could tell from the way that he was carrying his head and a certain tension in his body that they were approaching a crisis point.\nAnd the hypothesis: David and his mother were approaching a crisis point\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde.

I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.\nAnd the hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She longed for a weapon, for even a hairpin, and knowing that she did not have one, she knew too that she was totally defenceless, unarmed and alone. She could feel the great flight of the dragon and sensed that she was high in air and travelling fast towards the sunset. She could feel the great muscles of the dragon's wings send ripplings down the stomach walls and she gave herself over to death.\nAnd the hypothesis: the great muscles of the dragon's wings sent ripplings down the stomach walls\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Zenaida the sorceress jumped on her from behind, one hand at her throat, the other yanking at her hair. She screeched and the bird flapping over her head screeched with her but Carmellina could tell from the look in its pale green eye that it was her true love under a spell from the wicked enchantress and she fell to her knees and clutched the skirts of Zenaida.\nAnd the hypothesis: the bird was Carmellina's true love under a spell from the wicked enchantress\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.\nAnd the hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Jane ate without pausing.

Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.\nAnd the hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: I didn't say anything, but kept on eating slowly. I could tell that my father was looking at me from the other end of the table swilling his juice round in his glass and staring at my head as I bent over my plate.\nAnd the hypothesis: his father was looking at him from the other end of the table\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Jim waited.

I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.\nAnd the hypothesis: Alan meant it\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Your honesty shines out of your face, my darling. It isn't your fault that cynical men like myself won't let themselves believe what they see! I just wish you could believe that Eddie's death was an accident and nothing to do with me.\nAnd the hypothesis: Eddie's death was an accident and nothing to do with him\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Except that his face, with those tobacco-stained looking eyes and drooping moustache, was always the same and you never knew what he was thinking. When he looked at you it was like he knew something he wasn't telling, or was laughing at you, no matter what it was he said. That's when you could tell Henry Mendez was Mexican.\nAnd the hypothesis: Henry Mendez was Mexican\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: L.

Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.\nAnd the hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents.

It was not really my business although it could be said that I had known them both - had seen them about - for most of their lives.\nAnd the hypothesis: she had known Mr. and Mrs. McLeod for most of their lives\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: And I was excited by my new importance. Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect.

Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo.

Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nGiven the premise: For Syl I felt no sympathy, since if he was fool enough to want me he deserved none. In the course of time I would die and then it would all be over.

I wondered why McIllvanney had not told me that Rickie and Robin-Anne Crowninshield were drug addicts then I realised that McIllvanney would not have told me anything that might have risked my acceptance of the charter but now that I had learned that the twins had such a severe drug problem I was even less keen to take on the job.\nAnd the hypothesis: Rickie and Robin-Anne Crowninshield were drug addicts\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: It does not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised.

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before.

That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Colin hated the way he inspected the rag before folding the contents into the centre and forcing it into his trouser pocket. Smith obliged on all counts before announcing firmly, ``It was Arson.'' If Smith said it was Arson then that's what it was.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Arson\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.\nAnd the hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: And I was excited by my new importance. Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect. Perhaps I will convey a better idea of the tone of those evenings if I say that regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers and Mr John Donalds valet to Mr Sydney Dickenson.\nAnd the hypothesis: regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.'' Jean smiled. He might have known that even someone as sensible as Miss van Wiliamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort.\nAnd the hypothesis: even someone as sensible as Miss van Williamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort\nentailment\nGiven the premise: You will not dispute, I presume, that Mr Marshall of Charleville House and Mr Lane of Bridewood have been the two great butlers of recent times. Perhaps you might be persuaded that Mr Henderson of Branbury Castle also falls into this rare category. But you may think me merely biased if I say that my own father could in many ways be considered to rank with such men and that his career is the one I have always scrutinized for a definition of ``dignity''.\nAnd the hypothesis: his own father could in many ways be considered to rank with such men\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: However, I will let the gynandrous renegade stay here under one condition. If Penumbra questions either of us, we will not lie. If she suspects Crevecoeur is here and asks we let him go back.\nAnd the hypothesis: Crevecoeur is here\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.\nAnd the hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.\nAnd the hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: I shall not waver even at this supreme moment. Nor shall I again urge the objections cited above to the ``murderous conspiracy'' theory. I simply wish to point out that if it is supposed that Karen Parsons and I embarked that afternoon with the intention of drowning her husband why did we wait till we had reached a point where our criminal acts were overlooked by at least fifteen witnesses?\nAnd the hypothesis: he and Karen Parsons embarked that afternoon with the intention of drowning her husband\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.\nAnd the hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.\nAnd the hypothesis: Graham was gay too\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.\nAnd the hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: He had only to say he admired Grace Bird's fortitude and instantly her chin stiffened with resolve. He had but to comment favourably on the kittenish qualities of Babs Osborne for her to curl up as best she could on the plush seat beside him, her thumb in her mouth. Twenty-four hours later he admonished Babs for over-stressing the little-girl aspect of Cleopatra pointing out that childishness of character was not a question of years and that she was mistaken if she supposed the difference between folly and wisdom had anything to do with either age or youth.\nAnd the hypothesis: the difference between folly and wisdom had anything to do with either age or youth\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.\nAnd the hypothesis: the girl had a point\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.\nAnd the hypothesis: this was Tina's mother\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: Children aren't real people, in the sense that they are not small males and females but a separate species which will (probably) grow into one or the other in due time. Younger children in particular, before the insidious and evil influence of society and their parents have properly got to them, are sexlessly open and hence perfectly likeable. I did like Esmerelda (even if I thought her name was a bit soppy) and played with her a lot when she came to stay.\nAnd the hypothesis: Esmerelda's name was a bit soppy\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``That's good.'' Ruth stood looking at her. Rachaela could imagine Emma would have been all congratulations and the joys of womanhood.\nAnd the hypothesis: Emma would have been all congratulations and the joys of womanhood\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo.

Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.\nAnd the hypothesis: the girl had a point\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.\nAnd the hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt\nentailment\nGiven the premise: The meat tea was probably the answer. A big slice of ham, or grilled bacon, or a few sausages, and they could put a few extra on Benny's plate in case she felt the need of it. Annabel could hardly believe that she had a daughter about to go to university.\nAnd the hypothesis: Annabel had a daughter about to go to university\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed.

Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nGiven the premise: His microphone whistled a little and Sally winced in embarrassment. The first model appeared on the catwalk looking so glamorous so unbelievably chic that Sally could scarcely believe that her very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance.\nAnd the hypothesis: Sally's very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort.

It was not really my business although it could be said that I had known them both - had seen them about - for most of their lives.\nAnd the hypothesis: she had known Mr. and Mrs. McLeod for most of their lives\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?\nAnd the hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: And I was excited by my new importance. Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\nGiven the premise: I had been there and I knew it as a beautiful seaside resort, but that wasn't why I was so delighted. It was because it was in Yorkshire. As we marched out of the station into the streets of Scarborough I could hardly believe I was back in Yorkshire.\nAnd the hypothesis: he was back in Yorkshire\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.\nAnd the hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.\nAnd the hypothesis: Alan meant it\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: L. Underneath, in purple ink, had been added. ``And love, Fenella'', with a capital X as a kiss. I might have known Lisabeth wouldn't have walked up the stairs herself to leave the note.\nAnd the hypothesis: Lisabeth wouldn't have walked up the stairs herself to leave a note\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\nGiven the premise: He didn't say he loved her but,'' I think we're going to love each other, Lyn.'' From the pulled and sagging pockets of his jacket, his Sunday-go-to-meetings suit, his only suit, Dadda produced a cairngorm and silver ring for Lyn and a pearl-handled Stilton knife for Stephen. Though they might have forgotten that the following day would be the sixth anniversary of their engagement he with his prodigious memory had not.\nAnd the hypothesis: the following day would be the sixth anniversary of Lyn and Stephen's engagement\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.\nAnd the hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: He also liked swimming and cycling. He said that he wrote stories, though he had to admit that he had never got further than the first two pages. Willie meanwhile not only remained silent during these conversations but picked his berries slowly so that they might forget that he was there but he reckoned without Zach.\nAnd the hypothesis: Willie was there\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Country churches were never locked. You could wander in at any time. Perhaps Cromwell when he passed also found the door of Coldingham Priory locked and decided that he would get in anyway even if it meant removing a whole wall in order to do so.\nAnd the hypothesis: Cromwell would get in anyway\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked.

Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nGiven the premise: To get four miles they covered twenty, and they took nearly two hours. Edward was sweating lightly when they walked into the house. Perhaps he had hoped that Hannele would be there miraculously.\nAnd the hypothesis: Hannele would be there\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort.

Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?\nAnd the hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.\nAnd the hypothesis: Adam was down here\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked.

That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: ``Yeah.'' Lorton wondered what was the purpose of that unnecessary question.

I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket.

The man who had offered the seat had seen Ianthe as a tall fragile-looking woman in a pretty blue hat that matched her eyes. He might also have noticed that her dark hair was touched with grey and that although she was not exactly smart there was a kind of elegance about her.\nAnd the hypothesis: Ianthe's dark hair was touched with grey\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: The hypothesis does not entail that Ianthe's dark hair was touched with grey.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered.

A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: However, I will let the gynandrous renegade stay here under one condition.

That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London\nentailment\nGiven the premise: That's why he's locked up. I don't want him to know we 've got divers aboard and I especially don't want him to see me taking off with divers in the general direction of the Delos. If we find that there was no spare tank we shall have to keep an even closer eye on him.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was no spare tank\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: until they're older and then they look back. A: Yeah, it's true, um. what are some other questions they have, I'm not sure. I know my parents are growing up, I guess they never spent much time watching TV. In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the TV,\nAnd the hypothesis: his mom would turn on the TV\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.\nAnd the hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms. Because someone says a kilogram, no one knows what that is. A: Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I don't see that, it can change it very quickly.\nAnd the hypothesis: it can change it very quickly\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.\nAnd the hypothesis: the law will change\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.\nAnd the hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that, but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. B: Uh-huh. A: And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public. I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would be this private thing\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.\nAnd the hypothesis: his mother would want to be there\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't think it would crush steel cans,\nAnd the hypothesis: it would crush steel cans\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Well, that's true. A: I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a well I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.\nAnd the hypothesis: juries need to decide sentencing all the time\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't, I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could stay home all the time and do nothing\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.\nAnd the hypothesis: some of her relatives would really like to go there\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: and I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah A: Uh-huh. B: they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh, I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died. But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess, uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. Uh, A: But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.\nAnd the hypothesis: nursing homes really do a very good job\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know.

But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time,\nAnd the hypothesis: he could afford the boat\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either.\nAnd the hypothesis: she wants to see that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: What am I afraid of? A: Yes. B: Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: she needs them\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: something's going to be done about it\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah. Well, Do you have anything else to say? B: Well,  No, not too much more about credit cards. A: Okay. I don't think I do either\nAnd the hypothesis: she has more to say about credit cards\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.

I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.\nAnd the hypothesis: his mother would want to be there\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: It was just a side benefit. B: Yeah, yeah, because, I'm not big or anything, but I'm not in great shape, But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. A: Yeah. B: I don't think women look good with muscles.\nAnd the hypothesis: women look good with muscles\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, hormones, but yeah, uh, steroids. But, I stay from that crap. A: Yeah, it's too dangerous. B: Oh, I could just see hair would start growing out of my upper lip or something.\nAnd the hypothesis: hair would start growing out of her upper lip\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard of that movie\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah. How about Mister Rogers, is he still around? A: Yes. Yeah. They still show Mister Rogers. I don't think he's making new ones,\nAnd the hypothesis: Mister Rogers is making new Mister Rogers\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise.

And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.\nAnd the hypothesis: George Bush will make American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all. B: I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was a well thought out incentive\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I thought Carter was good too, and that was, yeah, B: Did you? I always liked him, I thought he was great at the time and I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him. you know, that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out.\nAnd the hypothesis: Carter got voted out\nentailment\nGiven the premise: A: But like I said if I voted for Bush, or like when, uh, Gary Hart was running, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking, B: Hart?  Uh-huh. A: not that I think he was good looking, but, he was young. B: Yeah.  Yeah. A: And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever.\nAnd the hypothesis: that was right\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: It does not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I thought Carter was good too, and that was, yeah, B: Did you? I always liked him, I thought he was great at the time and I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him. you know, that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out.\nAnd the hypothesis: Carter got voted out\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard of that movie\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway. B: Yeah. Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those Back To The Future, Part Three deals and that was crummy also. I didn't think that was any good\nAnd the hypothesis: that was any good\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.\nAnd the hypothesis: the law will change\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also. And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.\nAnd the hypothesis: one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Well, that's I meant when I said the school. A: Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. although I think that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, well, they do quite well for themselves. B: Huh. Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.\nAnd the hypothesis: the teachers in her school district were well paid\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.\nAnd the hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: And the long-range views are just kind of, become a thing of the past. A: Yeah you, B: And, uh, A: I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.\nAnd the hypothesis: there can be some more long range planning\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so it's nice to get away. It's just amazing, how much you miss. B: Yeah, it,  Yeah, it, yeah, it really is. I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,\nAnd the hypothesis: she has seen the Little Dipper\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, B: Yeah, yeah.  But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was grand. And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,\nAnd the hypothesis: there were all those lakes out there\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Highland Park's thinking about going that route. B: Uh-huh. A: So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do. B: Yeah, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of teachers are very professional\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.\nAnd the hypothesis: she has a philosophical problem with that\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, you mean, uh, learning type, uh, yeah? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission. B: Yes. A: But, yeah, I suppose, uh, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,\nAnd the hypothesis: the psychology department is pushing one form of education or another\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm not saying they're all bad,\nAnd the hypothesis: they're all bad\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh.

And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.\nAnd the hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual\nentailment\nGiven the premise: B: And they have said no. A: Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know. B: Yeah.

And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better\nAnd the hypothesis: it could be better\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.\nAnd the hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty, uh, innocuous. Although, uh, from what I hear in the news, and I saw an episode of the TV show, COPS uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and things like that, but I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's not all that common.\nAnd the hypothesis: those things happen too often\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.\nAnd the hypothesis: buying places is a hobby\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either.\nAnd the hypothesis: she wants to see that\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard of that movie\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: It's no more costly than renting one. The last, see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX TWO and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects, kind of gory and lots of, you know action. B: Uh-huh.  I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. A: Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,\nAnd the hypothesis: he doesn't follow performers\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Right. And I'm sure that would make a big difference, too. You know, you've got, A: Yeah. Well, what about a voluntary program? Do you think that would be a good idea?\nAnd the hypothesis: a voluntary program would be a good idea\nneutral\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: That most of it is plea bargained, uh, half way through or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway. B: Right. A: But, uh, uh, how do you feel uh, about the jury system itself? do you think that should be changed?\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury system should be changed\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: The premise does not entail the hypothesis.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\nAnd the hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise, I don't think it's going to be realistic. A: I know. Unfortunately, that's probably true. Um, do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids\nAnd the hypothesis: the parents spend quality time with their kids\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: They might be, but not at the human factors level. they're, B: Well, I heard it on the news today, I could swear it was IBM.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was IBM\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.\nAnd the hypothesis: she has a philosophical problem with that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: the police can do it alone\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: I think there really is. B: It's kind of an easy thing to talk about. A: Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.\nAnd the hypothesis: the work force would be the main\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: something's going to be done about it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with\nAnd the hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.\nAnd the hypothesis: some of her relatives would really like to go there\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, okay. uh, you ready to begin? B: We might as well. A: Oh, okay. Okay. B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right?\nAnd the hypothesis: they are doing care of the elderly\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things.

A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray.

There really wasn't a lot of difference. B: I didn't, see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie. That's interesting. That was a good movie, too. A: Well, do you think we covered baseball?\nAnd the hypothesis: they covered baseball\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah. Those are pretty.

B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: No, it was, I didn't like the way it ended. A: I know, well the only reason I know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: I can't believe they killed them.\nAnd the hypothesis: they killed them\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, it is. A: For instance, B: I'm a historian, and my father had kept them, I think, since nineteen twenty-seven uh, but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-, A: My goodness.

It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.\nAnd the hypothesis: George Bush will make American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: something's going to be done about it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect.

I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: not going to help. It's never helped my personal situation. I can't say it would help with theirs either.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would help with their personal situation\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh.

A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,\nAnd the hypothesis: it's going to go very far\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: But, no it would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline, wouldn't it? B: Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there. A: Uh-huh.

A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective.\nAnd the hypothesis: rehabilitation is effective\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either.

I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: No, it doesn't. B: And, of course, your court system when you get into the appeals, I don't believe criminal is in a court by itself.\nAnd the hypothesis: criminal is in a court by itself\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect.

I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: when you've lost something or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and you know, what you have and what you don't have. A: Yeah I agree. B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat?\nAnd the hypothesis: they're a security threat\nneutral\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes B: Yes. A: you know, it's not just a matter um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder um, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. B: I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on.\nAnd the hypothesis: they educate the jurors enough to really know what's going on\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: That's okay. B: Uh, yeah, this is, the, uh, mutual defense thing was, uh, we, it was complicated, and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation.\nAnd the hypothesis: everybody knows the whole situation\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.\nAnd the hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: That evening Shannon steered well clear of Dane, all but tiptoeing around him, determined not to land in any more confrontations.

B: and, uh, you know, just goodness. A: Yeah, I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,\nAnd the hypothesis: they do the packaging at this plant\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Um, in fact, Los Alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general. Um, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements. A: Well, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation. I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid of the heavy metals.\nAnd the hypothesis: someone around here would understand all those exotic techniques\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also. And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.\nAnd the hypothesis: one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, that's true., but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read, you know? Which, I mean it sounds like, uh, B: Uh-huh.  Yeah. That's true. A: now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have these, uh, sort of, -tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's started changing in the past few years\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: And why bother to write anyway?

He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: He often referred to the royal garden party when he was in a good frame of mind. Scarlet still found the episode entirely mysterious, since she could think of no reason at all why they had been invited. It was improbable in the extreme that Brian's sterling qualities had come to the notice of the Comptroller of the Household and she could only assume that the summons had been the consequence of her father's having been an RA.\nAnd the hypothesis: the summons had been the consequence of Scarlet's father's having been an RA\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period\nAnd the hypothesis: it was that expensive\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, say in the Bobsy twins or, something like that. A: Right.  You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out. I don't think there would be too many left.\nAnd the hypothesis: there would be too many left\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I.

This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.\nAnd the hypothesis: the cat was well\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. A: Well, um, they're really sweet dogs. uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and bred them.\nAnd the hypothesis: their neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place because of the family that had them and bred them\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, yes.

The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way.

He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer.

It was the same old-fashioned type as Miss Tuckey's and he unscrewed the mouthpiece carefully but found nothing extra inside.

I think it went out twice in two years and that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much. A: Huh-uh.

Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.\nAnd the hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,\nAnd the hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.\nAnd the hypothesis: there is too much of a relationship between the two\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right.

And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now.

A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, at, uh, it's TCJC. Tarrant County Junior College. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Okay. A: And it's really enjoyable. I like it. And then they also, you know, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption, and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.\nAnd the hypothesis: people can make laws to eliminate something every place totally\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.\nAnd the hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, but that, doesn't mean, B: But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?

The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice.

But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing.

A: Well, I mean, it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light, um, I don't know why they um, were more able than we were except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now\nAnd the hypothesis: they're just going to start using the things now\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also.

A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.

B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: That's it. A: And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything. B: Uh-huh. Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I do n't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to use it too frequently\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.

I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage.

B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I do too. I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time, but I don't, I believe that they're better now, you know, wh-, B: I think so. I don't think they're shoddy\nAnd the hypothesis: they're shoddy\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\nGiven the premise: A: That's true.

He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer.

Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break.

Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?\nAnd the hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage\nentailment\nGiven the premise: ``What do you mean she disappeared?'' It was a measure of his upset that Karel didn't even notice he was repeating himself.\nAnd the hypothesis: Karel was repeating himself\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.\nAnd the hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer. Moving carefully, Benny stepped around the edges of the room, and opened the window shutters. Her momentary horror at seeing the unmistakable form of General Etienne was only slightly dulled by the realization that the stiff posture he was in could only mean he was dead.\nAnd the hypothesis: General Etienne was dead\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence.

I was new at the school and still observing, still beginning friendships. Perhaps Alec noticed that I did not ridicule him as the others did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he did not ridicule Alec as the others did\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Your honesty shines out of your face, my darling.

I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea.

He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Why should a boat be less social than a caravan, for heaven's sake?

Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah.

Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,\nAnd the hypothesis: it's going to go very far\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold, but I think Iowa is a lot colder. A: Yeah, see, that's how it is in Texas, too because when it's cold, it's really cold. So, B: Yeah, I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.\nAnd the hypothesis: there are some mountains to stop the wind\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.\nAnd the hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.\nAnd the hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them, I guess. and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the uh, court clerks. B: Huh.  Yeah. Whatever. A: So it seems, uh, no, I do not think I would change it.

And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing. Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should do that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.

A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and you know, put another gallon of glass bottle in there. B: Yeah. A: So, uh, yeah, B: So, uh, you know, I look back at, uh, my childhood and I'd say, you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies.\nAnd the hypothesis: people are starting to put pressure on people to get away from all this throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say.

I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Sometimes you hear things on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.

B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\nGiven the premise: B: Um, gee, I don't, I mean, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know, they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.

At supper earlier the three of us had talked of Californian scientists who see the foetal heart accelerate translucent fingers tense and eye-muscles steer frantically through their dark when sounds of a high-revving motor are played to swelling, quizzically-smiling moms and wondered if there's anywhere on earth-Australasia or Amazonian forest-to find an unborn innocent of engines. Then it was time to watch ``Tomorrow's World'' and I thought of Sheila with her firstborn encircling him with Mozart in the womb but waking him at three months ' old to be a witness to be held up towards the moon on television so one day he could say he 'd shared in man's first giant steps.\nAnd the hypothesis: Sheila's firstborn had shared in man's first giant steps\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents.

And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: the Arabs all of a sudden uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis, so it's like, A: Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel.

So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period\nAnd the hypothesis: it was that expensive\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh.

I don't think they're shoddy\nAnd the hypothesis: they're shoddy\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, I mean it's. True. Yeah. A: I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I think that we should be spending more time and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Peace Corps is as successful now\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know.

Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Right, you know, like In packaging A: Yeah.

Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has used a typewriter to do a report\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, thirty years ago I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which, I don't think exists anymore. B: I know.  No. A: You never see one of those punch cards anymore. B: Uh, I think TV has a lot to do with the changes, too. Don't you?\nAnd the hypothesis: TV has a lot to do with the changes\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.\nAnd the hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?\nAnd the hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: I didn't really like the way the other boys treated him.

Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin.

Father Jankowski looked at me so kindly I could not tell him. I thought he might have guessed I was not normal.\nAnd the hypothesis: she was not normal\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Well, I was never there for any sentencing. Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day, and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case, and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty, and he would never vote for guilty. A: Huh. B: So, uh, they appointed me jury foreman and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,\nAnd the hypothesis: going in without deliberating allowed them to reach a verdict\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Right, they don't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system. B: Exactly.  Uh-huh, exactly. Uh, A: And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, uh, so, uh, it's not really my peers that, let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would be being tried by a jury of his peers\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: The premise does not entail the hypothesis.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Do you go to museums in Europe? B: Uh, actually, no, I don't think I went to any of them.\nAnd the hypothesis: she went to some of them\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. B: Oh, likewise. A: I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano.\nAnd the hypothesis: he should have to pay for dancing lessons\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.\nAnd the hypothesis: buying places is a hobby\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. B: Uh-huh. A: And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. B: Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.\nAnd the hypothesis: her husband was such a sucker for animals\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. A: Well, um, they're really sweet dogs. uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and bred them.\nAnd the hypothesis: their neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place because of the family that had them and bred them\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, yes. Animals have a way of talking. B: Alfie did. I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day. A: I don't know uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would trade his dog in for the world\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: But I like dogs and my husband likes cats. So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet. If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great, but until then, A: Yeah, I like both, but since I'm in an apartment, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.\nAnd the hypothesis: an apartment is big enough for a dog\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: So who knows? In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors. Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.\nAnd the hypothesis: finance is a service industry\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.\nAnd the hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.\nAnd the hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands.

They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.\nAnd the hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: The FCC effort collapsed. The networks and studios have bickered ever since. Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington, but that seems unlikely.\nAnd the hypothesis: the foreign influx will build more support in Washington\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?\nAnd the hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected\nneutral\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Soviet Union itself is a threat still\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: when you've lost something or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and you know, what you have and what you don't have. A: Yeah I agree. B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat?\nAnd the hypothesis: they're a security threat\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat? A: Yeah. B: Um, yes and no. A: Yeah, I can go with that answer too. The only yes I could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange, but I don't even see that occurring. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess. B: Um, no.  Well, I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Soviets really want to blow up the world\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh.

But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child.

But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind?

B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.

A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored.

B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels, Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice. B: No, I don't think there was. Um,\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a whole lot of choice\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: I didn't really like the way the other boys treated him.

But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade - ethnic differences. I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.\nAnd the hypothesis: the producers should start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: That is the reason, I don't play over there.

B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\nGiven the premise: A: That is the way to do it.

And, you know, uh, seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building. And you are supposed to feel safe, but then there are all these, does not matter race, but, you know, it is an inter racial mix. And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards. B: Yeah. A: And I do not even think that way, but I mean, you just think to yourself, you just, I mean, nobody can think that it can't happen to them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it can't happen to them\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.

A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, that's probably true.

Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Big time there, sure is.

How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know.

So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia.

A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,\nAnd the hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also.

A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it.

A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\nAnd the hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: What do you think about Robin Hood? B: Well, I work for school district and, uh, it has hurt us a lot. Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to equalize education opportunities. But, uh, you know, I think, especially big government, tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it. And I don't, you know, that's just not true. you know, I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.\nAnd the hypothesis: money is going to take the place of intelligence\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice.

Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I was angry with her for not saying anything, not doing anything.

Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate.

A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion.

A: you know, it's not just a matter um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder um, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.

Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo.

A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person.

B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents.

I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.

I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: I'll let you go first. B: Oh, well, what's there to say? Doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion. Seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: it makes any difference to sentence someone\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.

You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.

Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.\nAnd the hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: People are always mo-, you know, one out of every seven people moves every year. Uh, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: if you compound that, uh, eh- eh, if it is difficult to register to vote, that would remove your eligibility to vote. B: But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place, or, who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard.\nAnd the hypothesis: voter registration is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months..

So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person.

B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it.

The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef...

Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.\nAnd the hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her.

He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent.

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful.

It isn't your fault that cynical men like myself won't let themselves believe what they see!

A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills.

B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now.

Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.\nAnd the hypothesis: digging was such hard work\nentailment\nGiven the premise: After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate, it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer, a professional art restorer. Throughout the 1970s, Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural. Apparently the officials didn't even know the mural was missing until 1980, when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer's studio and questioned school officials about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: the mural was missing\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: The hypothesis does not entail the mural being missing. The mural was found by a concerned Stamford graduate and turned over to Hiram Hoelzer.\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use.

B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee.

Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect. Perhaps I will convey a better idea of the tone of those evenings if I say that regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers and Mr John Donalds valet to Mr Sydney Dickenson.\nAnd the hypothesis: regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, they did. They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside. Uh, it's funny watching them play, he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh, when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best. B: Uh-huh. A: And I haven't quite figured that out, if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing.\nAnd the hypothesis: they have got it won\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nora was going away alone\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Our groundshare next season will show what the team is really made of as we run out for home games on the unfamiliar battlefield of St Dodimeads Comprehensive. With the pitch being unavailable during term time, three-quarters of our games will be away. Travelling to these matches could of course prove expensive and some of our senior supporters may find they are unable to afford it.\nAnd the hypothesis: some senior supporters are unable to afford traveling to these matches\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.\nAnd the hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.\nAnd the hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Right. And they repacked the wheel bearings. A: and they repacked the the wheel bearings. Yeah but, uh, I've had considerable experience. you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic\nAnd the hypothesis: she is a good back yard mechanic\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: And, uh, the injector pump went bad so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it. And, uh, reinstalled that B: and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time. A: I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.\nAnd the hypothesis: she'd know where to start with a diesel\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. A: That's re-, yeah. B: I'm not saying they read all the right things\nAnd the hypothesis: they read all the right things\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: The notion that tracking is somehow ``undemocratic'' is absurd.  The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential. No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential.\nAnd the hypothesis: we all have an equal academic potential\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: Not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: Have you followed that very much or, B: Uh, not really. I don't think anything will ever take over the NFL.\nAnd the hypothesis: something will take over the NFL\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.  But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed. Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap.\nAnd the hypothesis: Manhattan comes cheap\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.\nAnd the hypothesis: someone in his house knows the difference\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: uh, those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year. A: Oh yeah. B: But I didn't know, I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers,\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard something on the Rangers\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Joseph spat and spluttered blood. He had lost the two centre top teeth and with the tip of his tongue he could feel that the two on either side were also loose.\nAnd the hypothesis: the two teeth on either side were also loose\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Then it cried. It was another girl. I was a little disappointed but I could only hope that Celia was still a bit hazy from the drugs.\nAnd the hypothesis: Celia was still a bit hazy from the drugs\nneutral\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period\nAnd the hypothesis: it was that expensive\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible.  Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease. Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.\nAnd the hypothesis: a bit of chromosome 13 was missing\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't, I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could stay home all the time and do nothing\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: yeah, obviously we don't have any and I think that's part of the role reversal, is it's okay to get married and not have kids. A: Oh yeah. B: And I think society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to have your family and I don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: That's fairly interesting. B: I bet that would be, rather interesting. Uh, that's, uh, self improvement, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh. A: Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.\nAnd the hypothesis: she reads anything strictly labeled self improvement\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better\nAnd the hypothesis: it could be better\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: It's depressing. B: Uh-huh, it is, and you know, you don't spi-, well. Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising, and uh, it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff, your body just gets used to it. Yeah, I don't particularly enjoy it. Well I used to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that. I do enjoy riding bike, but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that. Uh, I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much,\nAnd the hypothesis: he really enjoyed working out and lifting all that much\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.\nAnd the hypothesis: this was Tina's mother\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.\nAnd the hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Fernando's escaladun had been wonderful last night and not direct from the freezer. All his own work. She hadn't known he was such a good cook... She paid her bill and wandered back to where she had parked the car in a shady spot under an orange tree in a square - She didn't know a lot about Fernando Serra she realised with a dull bumping of her heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: Fernando was a good cook\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective.\nAnd the hypothesis: rehabilitation is effective\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,\nAnd the hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, but I don't think that it really actually does that. I don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes uh, are committed without any thought to the consequences\nAnd the hypothesis: it deters somebody\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with\nAnd the hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.\nAnd the hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, uh, B: Right. A: they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth, and he was definitely, just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of nursing home care,\nAnd the hypothesis: the man was in need of nursing home care\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it.

Or rather, now he was gone, I was Dennis. If I 'd been smarter or less vain I might have realized that this meant that my former role was now vacant.\nAnd the hypothesis: this meant her former role was now vacant\nentailment\nGiven the premise: Out on the waste ground is a guy with his head bashed in.

But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed. Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap.\nAnd the hypothesis: Manhattan comes cheap\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride.

B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all.

Because the federal Freedom of Information Act wasn't law at that time, the FBI wasn't required to turn over information on its investigations when Mr. Ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: B: That was surprising to me. A: Um. B: I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad. I'm trying to think, I didn't miss too many, I can't remember what my score was, but I did exceeding well. I was surprised. But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.\nAnd the hypothesis: their garbage isn't being decomposed\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare.

B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: I do too.

Um, I mean, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are, and I mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours. and right now, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just, well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there, I think we should just leave them alone. I really do. in a major way because um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself. B: Yeah. A: And that's the course that they should go, I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them, but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.\nAnd the hypothesis: this intervention at such high levels should be going on\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.\nAnd the hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess. They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are A: Um. Right. B: you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too. A: Yeah. And I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern, uh, rock and roll,\nAnd the hypothesis: she likes a lot of the very modern rock and roll\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Highland Park's thinking about going that route. B: Uh-huh. A: So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do. B: Yeah, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of teachers are very professional\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: It was just a side benefit. B: Yeah, yeah, because, I'm not big or anything, but I'm not in great shape, But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. A: Yeah. B: I don't think women look good with muscles.\nAnd the hypothesis: women look good with muscles\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: and, they seem pretty, you know, they don't have the hard body. They don't have that perfect look, and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious. But you know, they live to a hundred and ten some, you know, B: Yeah, A: And, that's, B: Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of that is diet  too\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.\nAnd the hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,\nAnd the hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, but I don't think that it really actually does that.\nAnd the hypothesis: it really actually does that\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``And you're wrong about us. We're not children and I 'd say we're learning the rules pretty quickly.'' You may have noticed I'm not shaking any more!\nAnd the hypothesis: he's not shaking any more\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.\nAnd the hypothesis: the tape had run out\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think I can keep my own garbage.\nAnd the hypothesis: she can keep her own garbage\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better\nAnd the hypothesis: it could be better\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: ``We're about to run out of time. I would like to thank you for coming into the studio today, and I'm sure we 'll receive a lot of letters from our listeners about what's been said.'' You could find that this is just the beginning and that your plans aren't quite as cut and dried as they appear.\nAnd the hypothesis: this is just the beginning\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.\nAnd the hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed.

Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\nGiven the premise: ``Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory. It's just a strange feeling.''

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents.

A: Right because you've got all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. B: Right. A: Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent.

A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty.

B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\nGiven the premise: A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, or current, B: Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times. And, uh, I really did enjoy that. I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything,\nAnd the hypothesis: she ever learned to drive the motor boat\nDoes it entail or not entail?\nPrediction: not entail\n\nPrompt 1: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working.

I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.

That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\nBased on the information: Polly had to think quickly.

I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: It was dark and well stormy by the time I got to the Aurora Corona Rest Home and the residents were probably battened down for the night. I parked Armstrong on the road and walked down the short drive to the impressive Gothic porch around the front door. That at least had a light showing and at first I thought the rest of the building was in total darkness but as I crunched gravel and got closer I could see they used extra thick curtains maybe left-overs from the Blackout.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the residents used extra thick curtains\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: I WAS really only a bystander in the tragedy of young Mr and Mrs McLeod. It was not really my business although it could be said that I had known them both - had seen them about - for most of their lives.\nAnd the hypothesis: she had known Mr. and Mrs. McLeod for most of their lives\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I didn't really like the way the other boys treated him. I was new at the school and still observing, still beginning friendships. Perhaps Alec noticed that I did not ridicule him as the others did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he did not ridicule Alec as the others did\nentailment\nBased on the information: And if anyone had noticed, maybe I could have just tossed the whole matter off in a casual way. ``Oh, that... it's nothing much...'' No, it's too easy to forget that something which I hardly ever think about now was then a very great concern. I was aware what could happen I could see that any weakness was pounced upon by the other boys and I knew that I wasn't big enough or belligerent enough to bully my way out of it.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: any weakness was pounced upon by the other boys\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.\nAnd the hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: How did Selden know that the hound was following him? We know he ran a long way. He was screaming for a long time before he fell and we could hear that he was running as he screamed.\nAnd the hypothesis: Selden was running as he screamed\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: ``Oh, very well,'' he said wearily. He might have known that it was useless to argue with McAllister - her tongue was as long as her will was strong.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was useless to argue with McAllister\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.\nAnd the hypothesis: the call was long-distance\nentailment\nBased on the information: ``That's no problem,'' he grinned, unabashed. ``We have a perfectly efficient paging system, isn't that right, Niall?'' Lindsey saw the dark brow come down and from his thunderous expression could tell Niall was furious.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Niall was furious\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: That evening Shannon steered well clear of Dane, all but tiptoeing around him, determined not to land in any more confrontations. From now till this snow siege ended, she would simply live under the same roof, but keep to her own side of an invisible barrier, she decided. She could only hope he 'd do the same.\nAnd the hypothesis: Dane would do the same\nneutral\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was wrong\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Gloria remarked as they shared their coffee break in the kitchen. Melissa suppressed a sigh. She had hoped to dodge the subject but might have known that Gloria's boundless interest in all things morbid and sensational would make it impossible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gloria's boundless interest in all things morbid and sensational would make dodging the subject impossible\nentailment\nBased on the information: David had obviously always known and Julia had learned that, whatever feelings were churning around inside his mother's mind, it was vital for her that they remained private. David was holding the strings in a pattern Julia had never seen before. His face seemed to show nothing except benevolent interest but Julia could tell from the way that he was carrying his head and a certain tension in his body that they were approaching a crisis point.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: David and his mother were approaching a crisis point\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.\nAnd the hypothesis: this was Tina's mother\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.\nAnd the hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She longed for a weapon, for even a hairpin, and knowing that she did not have one, she knew too that she was totally defenceless, unarmed and alone. She could feel the great flight of the dragon and sensed that she was high in air and travelling fast towards the sunset. She could feel the great muscles of the dragon's wings send ripplings down the stomach walls and she gave herself over to death.\nAnd the hypothesis: the great muscles of the dragon's wings sent ripplings down the stomach walls\nentailment\nBased on the information: Zenaida the sorceress jumped on her from behind, one hand at her throat, the other yanking at her hair. She screeched and the bird flapping over her head screeched with her but Carmellina could tell from the look in its pale green eye that it was her true love under a spell from the wicked enchantress and she fell to her knees and clutched the skirts of Zenaida.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the bird was Carmellina's true love under a spell from the wicked enchantress\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.\nAnd the hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.\nAnd the hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort.

Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.\nAnd the hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: I didn't say anything, but kept on eating slowly. I could tell that my father was looking at me from the other end of the table swilling his juice round in his glass and staring at my head as I bent over my plate.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: his father was looking at him from the other end of the table\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Jim waited.

Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was wrong\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Joseph spat and spluttered blood. He had lost the two centre top teeth and with the tip of his tongue he could feel that the two on either side were also loose.\nAnd the hypothesis: the two teeth on either side were also loose\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.\nAnd the hypothesis: Alan meant it\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Your honesty shines out of your face, my darling. It isn't your fault that cynical men like myself won't let themselves believe what they see! I just wish you could believe that Eddie's death was an accident and nothing to do with me.\nAnd the hypothesis: Eddie's death was an accident and nothing to do with him\nentailment\nBased on the information: Except that his face, with those tobacco-stained looking eyes and drooping moustache, was always the same and you never knew what he was thinking. When he looked at you it was like he knew something he wasn't telling, or was laughing at you, no matter what it was he said. That's when you could tell Henry Mendez was Mexican.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Henry Mendez was Mexican\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: L.

Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.\nAnd the hypothesis: Alan meant it\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments.

Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage\nentailment\nBased on the information: ``I 've already got money that I 've saved from Grye's winnings.''

Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect.

Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.\nAnd the hypothesis: Woil was afraid\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.\nAnd the hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.\nAnd the hypothesis: Adam was down here\nentailment\nBased on the information: Laying the Christmas decoration on the eiderdown with care, he thought about Vic. What had he really been saying as they sat among the trees? Did he mean that Mungo was not welcome here?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Mungo was not welcome here\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.\nAnd the hypothesis: the tape had run out\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.\nAnd the hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?\nAnd the hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer. Moving carefully, Benny stepped around the edges of the room, and opened the window shutters. Her momentary horror at seeing the unmistakable form of General Etienne was only slightly dulled by the realization that the stiff posture he was in could only mean he was dead.\nAnd the hypothesis: General Etienne was dead\nentailment\nBased on the information: Obispal's gaze drifted towards Meh ` Lindi, and he frowned as if adding the final piece to a puzzle which had been perplexing him, but not liking the pattern that he saw. Did Obispal's associates realize that the rashly rampaging Inquisitor was only present in this auditorium courtesy of Jaq's Assassin who had plucked him to safety?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the rashly rampaging Inquisitor was only present in this auditorium courtesy of Jaq's Assassin\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``Oh, very well,'' he said wearily. He might have known that it was useless to argue with McAllister - her tongue was as long as her will was strong.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was useless to argue with McAllister\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: ``That's good.'' Ruth stood looking at her. Rachaela could imagine Emma would have been all congratulations and the joys of womanhood.\nAnd the hypothesis: Emma would have been all congratulations and the joys of womanhood\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Matthew rode on feeling a little more at peace with himself. He skirted the spruce plantation and supposed that at some point he should tell Sara about it. He could imagine that she might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year.\nAnd the hypothesis: Sara might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry?

Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\nBased on the information: I promised Mr Harvey I would. Of course, he's terribly anxious for me to settle down out there, marry Cora-Beth and become an American citizen, the way his father did years ago. Do you realize that according to some strange Scottish law about dynasties Cora-Beth is now heir to the title and the Kinmuire estate?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Cora-Beth is now heir to the title and the Kinmuire estate\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: No, it was, I didn't like the way it ended. A: I know, well the only reason I know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: I can't believe they killed them.\nAnd the hypothesis: they killed them\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention.

Smith obliged on all counts before announcing firmly, ``It was Arson.'' If Smith said it was Arson then that's what it was.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it was Arson\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.\nAnd the hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: And I was excited by my new importance.

Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect. Perhaps I will convey a better idea of the tone of those evenings if I say that regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers and Mr John Donalds valet to Mr Sydney Dickenson.\nAnd the hypothesis: regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.'' Jean smiled. He might have known that even someone as sensible as Miss van Wiliamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort.\nAnd the hypothesis: even someone as sensible as Miss van Williamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort\nentailment\nBased on the information: You will not dispute, I presume, that Mr Marshall of Charleville House and Mr Lane of Bridewood have been the two great butlers of recent times. Perhaps you might be persuaded that Mr Henderson of Branbury Castle also falls into this rare category. But you may think me merely biased if I say that my own father could in many ways be considered to rank with such men and that his career is the one I have always scrutinized for a definition of ``dignity''.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: his own father could in many ways be considered to rank with such men\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: However, I will let the gynandrous renegade stay here under one condition. If Penumbra questions either of us, we will not lie. If she suspects Crevecoeur is here and asks we let him go back.\nAnd the hypothesis: Crevecoeur is here\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.\nAnd the hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.\nAnd the hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: I shall not waver even at this supreme moment. Nor shall I again urge the objections cited above to the ``murderous conspiracy'' theory. I simply wish to point out that if it is supposed that Karen Parsons and I embarked that afternoon with the intention of drowning her husband why did we wait till we had reached a point where our criminal acts were overlooked by at least fifteen witnesses?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he and Karen Parsons embarked that afternoon with the intention of drowning her husband\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.\nAnd the hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.\nAnd the hypothesis: Graham was gay too\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.\nAnd the hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: He had only to say he admired Grace Bird's fortitude and instantly her chin stiffened with resolve. He had but to comment favourably on the kittenish qualities of Babs Osborne for her to curl up as best she could on the plush seat beside him, her thumb in her mouth. Twenty-four hours later he admonished Babs for over-stressing the little-girl aspect of Cleopatra pointing out that childishness of character was not a question of years and that she was mistaken if she supposed the difference between folly and wisdom had anything to do with either age or youth.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the difference between folly and wisdom had anything to do with either age or youth\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked.

A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: Children aren't real people, in the sense that they are not small males and females but a separate species which will (probably) grow into one or the other in due time. Younger children in particular, before the insidious and evil influence of society and their parents have properly got to them, are sexlessly open and hence perfectly likeable. I did like Esmerelda (even if I thought her name was a bit soppy) and played with her a lot when she came to stay.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Esmerelda's name was a bit soppy\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``That's good.''

Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.\nAnd the hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt\nentailment\nBased on the information: The meat tea was probably the answer. A big slice of ham, or grilled bacon, or a few sausages, and they could put a few extra on Benny's plate in case she felt the need of it. Annabel could hardly believe that she had a daughter about to go to university.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Annabel had a daughter about to go to university\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed.

Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nBased on the information: His microphone whistled a little and Sally winced in embarrassment. The first model appeared on the catwalk looking so glamorous so unbelievably chic that Sally could scarcely believe that her very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Sally's very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort.

It was not really my business although it could be said that I had known them both - had seen them about - for most of their lives.\nAnd the hypothesis: she had known Mr. and Mrs. McLeod for most of their lives\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\nBased on the information: I had been there and I knew it as a beautiful seaside resort, but that wasn't why I was so delighted. It was because it was in Yorkshire. As we marched out of the station into the streets of Scarborough I could hardly believe I was back in Yorkshire.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he was back in Yorkshire\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.\nAnd the hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.\nAnd the hypothesis: Alan meant it\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: L.

From the pulled and sagging pockets of his jacket, his Sunday-go-to-meetings suit, his only suit, Dadda produced a cairngorm and silver ring for Lyn and a pearl-handled Stilton knife for Stephen.

He said that he wrote stories, though he had to admit that he had never got further than the first two pages. Willie meanwhile not only remained silent during these conversations but picked his berries slowly so that they might forget that he was there but he reckoned without Zach.\nAnd the hypothesis: Willie was there\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Country churches were never locked. You could wander in at any time. Perhaps Cromwell when he passed also found the door of Coldingham Priory locked and decided that he would get in anyway even if it meant removing a whole wall in order to do so.\nAnd the hypothesis: Cromwell would get in anyway\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked.

Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nBased on the information: To get four miles they covered twenty, and they took nearly two hours. Edward was sweating lightly when they walked into the house. Perhaps he had hoped that Hannele would be there miraculously.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Hannele would be there\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort.

Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?\nAnd the hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.\nAnd the hypothesis: Adam was down here\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: ``Yeah.'' Lorton wondered what was the purpose of that unnecessary question. Perhaps Maxham already knew that the Newleys ' burglar alarm was one of the early Custodemus models.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the Newleys ' burglar alarm was one of the early Custodemus models\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking.

She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.\nAnd the hypothesis: this was Tina's mother\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.'' Jean smiled. He might have known that even someone as sensible as Miss van Wiliamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort.\nAnd the hypothesis: even someone as sensible as Miss van Williamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort\nentailment\nBased on the information: It was as if they realised that she was not for the rough and tumble of this world, like the aggressive women with shaggy hair styles who pushed their way through life thrusting their hard shopping baskets at defenceless men. The man who had offered the seat had seen Ianthe as a tall fragile-looking woman in a pretty blue hat that matched her eyes. He might also have noticed that her dark hair was touched with grey and that although she was not exactly smart there was a kind of elegance about her.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Ianthe's dark hair was touched with grey\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered.

A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: However, I will let the gynandrous renegade stay here under one condition. If Penumbra questions either of us, we will not lie. If she suspects Crevecoeur is here and asks we let him go back.\nAnd the hypothesis: Crevecoeur is here\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London\nentailment\nBased on the information: That's why he's locked up. I don't want him to know we 've got divers aboard and I especially don't want him to see me taking off with divers in the general direction of the Delos. If we find that there was no spare tank we shall have to keep an even closer eye on him.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there was no spare tank\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: until they're older and then they look back. A: Yeah, it's true, um. what are some other questions they have, I'm not sure. I know my parents are growing up, I guess they never spent much time watching TV. In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the TV,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: his mom would turn on the TV\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.\nAnd the hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms. Because someone says a kilogram, no one knows what that is. A: Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I don't see that, it can change it very quickly.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it can change it very quickly\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.\nAnd the hypothesis: the law will change\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.\nAnd the hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that, but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. B: Uh-huh. A: And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public. I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it would be this private thing\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.\nAnd the hypothesis: his mother would want to be there\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't think it would crush steel cans,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it would crush steel cans\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So.

I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Well, that's true. A: I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a well I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: juries need to decide sentencing all the time\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't, I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could stay home all the time and do nothing\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.\nAnd the hypothesis: some of her relatives would really like to go there\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: and I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah A: Uh-huh. B: they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh, I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died. But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess, uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. Uh, A: But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: nursing homes really do a very good job\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know.

But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have.

I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use.

B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B: and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Dodge Omni was a very quality car\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.\nAnd the hypothesis: she would do it to her parents\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period\nAnd the hypothesis: it was that expensive\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things. We di-, for us it really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it. B: Uh-huh.  Oh, definitely, definitely. I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, I guess, probably three years ago for Christmas, and, you know, it's got some stuff on it. It's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff. And I don't think she's ever touched it you know.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: her mother has ever touched the computer\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the EP  and lots of different places B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. B: Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: that was a new revelation\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do.

B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.\nAnd the hypothesis: George Bush will make American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all.

I always liked him, I thought he was great at the time and I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him. you know, that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out.\nAnd the hypothesis: Carter got voted out\nentailment\nBased on the information: A: But like I said if I voted for Bush, or like when, uh, Gary Hart was running, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking, B: Hart?  Uh-huh. A: not that I think he was good looking, but, he was young. B: Yeah.  Yeah. A: And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: that was right\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I thought Carter was good too, and that was, yeah, B: Did you?

Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard of that movie\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway. B: Yeah. Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those Back To The Future, Part Three deals and that was crummy also. I didn't think that was any good\nAnd considering the hypothesis: that was any good\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.\nAnd the hypothesis: the law will change\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also. And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.\nAnd the hypothesis: one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Well, that's I meant when I said the school. A: Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. although I think that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, well, they do quite well for themselves. B: Huh. Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the teachers in her school district were well paid\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.\nAnd the hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: And the long-range views are just kind of, become a thing of the past. A: Yeah you, B: And, uh, A: I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there can be some more long range planning\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: so it's nice to get away. It's just amazing, how much you miss. B: Yeah, it,  Yeah, it, yeah, it really is. I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,\nAnd the hypothesis: she has seen the Little Dipper\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: But, uh, B: Yeah, yeah.  But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was grand. And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there were all those lakes out there\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Highland Park's thinking about going that route. B: Uh-huh. A: So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do. B: Yeah, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of teachers are very professional\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.\nAnd the hypothesis: she has a philosophical problem with that\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Oh, you mean, uh, learning type, uh, yeah? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission. B: Yes. A: But, yeah, I suppose, uh, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the psychology department is pushing one form of education or another\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm not saying they're all bad,\nAnd the hypothesis: they're all bad\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh.

A: Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know. B: Yeah.

A: But, I don't think we gained any weight from it\nAnd the hypothesis: they gained any weight from it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. B: Uh-huh. A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: they did it\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either.\nAnd the hypothesis: she wants to see that\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: the police can do it alone\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.\nAnd the hypothesis: his mother would want to be there\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Oh, I do too. A: So anyway it's still, B: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And, you know, if she wanted to go to combat, I do not see that they should stop her.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: they should stop her\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area\nAnd the hypothesis: they were in this area\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.\nAnd the hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: But, I do n't get into uh, the real women libber movement, you know. A: No, I do n't either. I do n't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: that they're going to prove that men and women are equal\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better\nAnd the hypothesis: it could be better\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.\nAnd the hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\nBased on the information: A: Yeah, but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty, uh, innocuous. Although, uh, from what I hear in the news, and I saw an episode of the TV show, COPS uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and things like that, but I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's not all that common.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: those things happen too often\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.\nAnd the hypothesis: buying places is a hobby\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either.\nAnd the hypothesis: she wants to see that\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has heard of that movie\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: It's no more costly than renting one. The last, see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX TWO and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects, kind of gory and lots of, you know action. B: Uh-huh.  I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. A: Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he doesn't follow performers\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?\nAnd the hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term\nneutral\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Right. And I'm sure that would make a big difference, too. You know, you've got, A: Yeah. Well, what about a voluntary program? Do you think that would be a good idea?\nAnd the hypothesis: a voluntary program would be a good idea\nneutral\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: That most of it is plea bargained, uh, half way through or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway. B: Right. A: But, uh, uh, how do you feel uh, about the jury system itself? do you think that should be changed?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the jury system should be changed\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\nAnd the hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise, I don't think it's going to be realistic. A: I know. Unfortunately, that's probably true. Um, do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the parents spend quality time with their kids\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: They might be, but not at the human factors level. they're, B: Well, I heard it on the news today, I could swear it was IBM.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was IBM\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.\nAnd the hypothesis: she has a philosophical problem with that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.\nAnd the hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: the police can do it alone\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.\nAnd the hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: I think there really is. B: It's kind of an easy thing to talk about. A: Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the work force would be the main\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect.

I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: something's going to be done about it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with\nAnd the hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.\nAnd the hypothesis: some of her relatives would really like to go there\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Oh, okay. uh, you ready to begin?

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too.

A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah.

A: I know, well the only reason I know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: I can't believe they killed them.\nAnd the hypothesis: they killed them\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Yeah, it is.

B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,\nAnd the hypothesis: it's going to go very far\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: But, no it would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline, wouldn't it? B: Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there. A: Uh-huh.

A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.

You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.\nAnd the hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.\nAnd the hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.\nAnd the hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: He has been told simply that I object to marriage with Artai. If he believes that I have exhibited any preference for his person above that of the others who have offered for my hand then he is a fool.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: she has exhibited preference for his person above that of the others\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was Edward's fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Matthew rode on feeling a little more at peace with himself.

And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: Perhaps I might have recognized my own hypocrisy, if it had not been for Richard's behaviour in the next months. He brought me flowers, took me out to dinner and the theatre, and was generally attentive to me, as if I were his mistress and not an old married woman. If at any point I thought that his solicitude was the sort of tender kindness you might show to someone utterly dependent and helpless - a prisoner or a caged bird - I was ashamed at once and re-doubled my efforts to be a good wife asking Nonni to teach me how to cook the elaborate dishes Richard liked and taking care to change my dress before he came home in the evening.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Richard's solicitude was the sort of tender kindness you might show to someone utterly dependent and helpless\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.\nAnd the hypothesis: something's going to be done about it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,\nAnd the hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.\nAnd the hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them, I guess. and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the uh, court clerks. B: Huh.  Yeah. Whatever. A: So it seems, uh, no, I do not think I would change it.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he would change it\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Right, you know, like In packaging A: Yeah. B: and, uh, you know, just goodness. A: Yeah, I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,\nAnd the hypothesis: they do the packaging at this plant\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Um, in fact, Los Alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general. Um, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements. A: Well, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation. I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid of the heavy metals.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: someone around here would understand all those exotic techniques\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,\nAnd the hypothesis: as many parents are college educated at the public school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also. And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.\nAnd the hypothesis: one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\nBased on the information: A: Yeah, that's true., but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read, you know? Which, I mean it sounds like, uh, B: Uh-huh.  Yeah. That's true. A: now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have these, uh, sort of, -tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it's started changing in the past few years\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: And why bother to write anyway?

Scarlet still found the episode entirely mysterious, since she could think of no reason at all why they had been invited. It was improbable in the extreme that Brian's sterling qualities had come to the notice of the Comptroller of the Household and she could only assume that the summons had been the consequence of her father's having been an RA.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the summons had been the consequence of Scarlet's father's having been an RA\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise.

A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Yeah, and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, say in the Bobsy twins or, something like that. A: Right.  You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out.

I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,\nAnd the hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there is too much of a relationship between the two\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah.

And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass\nAnd the hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Uh, at, uh, it's TCJC. Tarrant County Junior College. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Okay. A: And it's really enjoyable. I like it. And then they also, you know, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption, and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: people can make laws to eliminate something every place totally\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.\nAnd the hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.

A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,\nAnd the hypothesis: they've gone that far\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right.

B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah.

Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.\nAnd the hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Yeah, but that, doesn't mean, B: But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?

The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way.

So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person.

B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime.

So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.

He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer. Moving carefully, Benny stepped around the edges of the room, and opened the window shutters. Her momentary horror at seeing the unmistakable form of General Etienne was only slightly dulled by the realization that the stiff posture he was in could only mean he was dead.\nAnd the hypothesis: General Etienne was dead\nentailment\nBased on the information: The window-boxes were in full bloom.

The way I ought to look, the way I should look, the way I might have looked if I hadn't had my little accident. Looking at me you 'd never guess I 'd killed three people.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: she had killed three people\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.\nAnd the hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: ``And you're wrong about us.

But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.\nAnd the hypothesis: something was amiss\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break.

Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his.

It was a measure of his upset that Karel didn't even notice he was repeating himself.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Karel was repeating himself\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.\nAnd the hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: There was no answer.

I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has given up the weed\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them.

She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.\nAnd the hypothesis: falling in love had happened\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: It was Alan's idea.

Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\nBased on the information: Why should a boat be less social than a caravan, for heaven's sake?

If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Yeah.

A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh.

So, B: Yeah, I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there are some mountains to stop the wind\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: but that is one of my solutions.

Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.\nAnd the hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them, I guess. and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the uh, court clerks.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,\nAnd the hypothesis: teachers talk\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing. Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should do that\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.

B: Yeah. A: So, uh, yeah, B: So, uh, you know, I look back at, uh, my childhood and I'd say, you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: people are starting to put pressure on people to get away from all this throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say.

A: No, not when you figure, I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure\nAnd the hypothesis: one cow produces that much manure\nentailment\nBased on the information: B: Um, gee, I don't, I mean, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know, they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that. A: Right. B: So, I believe them but I'm not a chemist.

Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.\nAnd the hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: So who knows? In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors. Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.\nAnd the hypothesis: finance is a service industry\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: I WAS really only a bystander in the tragedy of young Mr and Mrs McLeod. It was not really my business although it could be said that I had known them both - had seen them about - for most of their lives.\nAnd the hypothesis: she had known Mr. and Mrs. McLeod for most of their lives\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: And, such is trust, they went on seeing it after it had gone, for by now they were used to the constant and bewildering ebb and flow of Stevenson money. Each banker took it to be part of some Brand strategy of which he was privileged to see, and be entrusted with, but a small portion. They did not notice that there was now more ebb than flow.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: there was now more ebb than flow\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.\nAnd the hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Gloria remarked as they shared their coffee break in the kitchen.

I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.\nAnd the hypothesis: Nora was going away alone\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\nBased on the information: In the clenched-to-cracking night We mouthed the hope, gave it a name: twenty-sixty-two still trembles in the flinching air and catches, bright rag on a bramble. At supper earlier the three of us had talked of Californian scientists who see the foetal heart accelerate translucent fingers tense and eye-muscles steer frantically through their dark when sounds of a high-revving motor are played to swelling, quizzically-smiling moms and wondered if there's anywhere on earth-Australasia or Amazonian forest-to find an unborn innocent of engines. Then it was time to watch ``Tomorrow's World'' and I thought of Sheila with her firstborn encircling him with Mozart in the womb but waking him at three months ' old to be a witness to be held up towards the moon on television so one day he could say he 'd shared in man's first giant steps.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: Sheila's firstborn had shared in man's first giant steps\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents.

B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.\nAnd the hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame\nAnd the hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently\nAnd the hypothesis: somebody roots differently\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: the Arabs all of a sudden uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis, so it's like, A: Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel. B: Yeah I, A: And did you know John Sununu is, uh, half Arab?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: John Sununu is half Arab\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period\nAnd the hypothesis: it was that expensive\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think I can keep my own garbage.\nAnd the hypothesis: she can keep her own garbage\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: I do too.

Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,\nAnd the hypothesis: it acts much as a deterrent to these people\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B: I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,\nAnd the hypothesis: things are being made better\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: Yeah, I mean it's. True. Yeah. A: I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I think that we should be spending more time and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the Peace Corps is as successful now\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.\nAnd the hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Right, you know, like In packaging A: Yeah.

A: Yeah, I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,\nAnd the hypothesis: they do the packaging at this plant\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out.\nAnd the hypothesis: he has used a typewriter to do a report\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Yeah, thirty years ago I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which, I don't think exists anymore. B: I know.  No. A: You never see one of those punch cards anymore. B: Uh, I think TV has a lot to do with the changes, too. Don't you?\nAnd considering the hypothesis: TV has a lot to do with the changes\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: entailment\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it\nAnd the hypothesis: it was his fault\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.\nAnd the hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?\nAnd the hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: I didn't really like the way the other boys treated him. I was new at the school and still observing, still beginning friendships. Perhaps Alec noticed that I did not ridicule him as the others did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he did not ridicule Alec as the others did\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: And I was excited by my new importance. Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin. Occasionally perhaps I should notice that he was not the jovial easy-going character I remembered from my humble place in the chorus.\nAnd the hypothesis: Frank Donovan was not the jovial easy-going character she remembered\nentailment\nBased on the information: For the first time in my life I could not confess all my sins to the priest. Father Jankowski looked at me so kindly I could not tell him. I thought he might have guessed I was not normal.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: she was not normal\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.\nAnd the hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,\nAnd the hypothesis: it should be unanimous\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Well, I was never there for any sentencing. Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day, and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case, and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty, and he would never vote for guilty. A: Huh. B: So, uh, they appointed me jury foreman and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,\nAnd the hypothesis: going in without deliberating allowed them to reach a verdict\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.\nAnd the hypothesis: they can really do something to change it\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: Right, they don't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system. B: Exactly.  Uh-huh, exactly. Uh, A: And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, uh, so, uh, it's not really my peers that, let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he would be being tried by a jury of his peers\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.\nAnd the hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.\nAnd the hypothesis: that is going to work\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Do you go to museums in Europe? B: Uh, actually, no, I don't think I went to any of them.\nAnd the hypothesis: she went to some of them\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. B: Oh, likewise. A: I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he should have to pay for dancing lessons\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.\nAnd the hypothesis: buying places is a hobby\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. B: Uh-huh. A: And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. B: Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.\nAnd the hypothesis: her husband was such a sucker for animals\nentailment\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. A: Well, um, they're really sweet dogs. uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and bred them.\nAnd the hypothesis: their neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place because of the family that had them and bred them\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Oh, yes. Animals have a way of talking. B: Alfie did. I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day. A: I don't know uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would trade his dog in for the world\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: But I like dogs and my husband likes cats. So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet. If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great, but until then, A: Yeah, I like both, but since I'm in an apartment, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: an apartment is big enough for a dog\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: So who knows? In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors. Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.\nAnd the hypothesis: finance is a service industry\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.\nAnd the hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.\nAnd the hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.\nAnd the hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.\nAnd the hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: The FCC effort collapsed. The networks and studios have bickered ever since. Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington, but that seems unlikely.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the foreign influx will build more support in Washington\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?\nAnd the hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected\nneutral\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.\nAnd the hypothesis: the Soviet Union itself is a threat still\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that. A: Exactly. B: And, A: Yeah, uh, that, personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat, and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gorbachev is going to be allowed to get away with doing some change\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: when you've lost something or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and you know, what you have and what you don't have. A: Yeah I agree. B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat?\nAnd the hypothesis: they're a security threat\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat? A: Yeah. B: Um, yes and no. A: Yeah, I can go with that answer too. The only yes I could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange, but I don't even see that occurring. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess. B: Um, no.

And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways.

You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.\nAnd the hypothesis: that's done much anywhere\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.\nAnd the hypothesis: it's done\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: it works that way\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.\nAnd the hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.\nAnd the hypothesis: the law will change\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\nAnd the hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?\nAnd the hypothesis: there should be a nationwide curriculum\nneutral\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.\nAnd the hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: A: What do you think about Robin Hood? B: Well, I work for school district and, uh, it has hurt us a lot. Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to equalize education opportunities. But, uh, you know, I think, especially big government, tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it. And I don't, you know, that's just not true. you know, I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: money is going to take the place of intelligence\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice.

He might have known that it was useless to argue with McAllister - her tongue was as long as her will was strong.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was useless to argue with McAllister\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland. The two are also signing a trade agreement. South Korean government officials said they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can ``offer experience.''\nAnd the hypothesis: Seoul can loan money to Warsaw\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect. Perhaps I will convey a better idea of the tone of those evenings if I say that regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers and Mr John Donalds valet to Mr Sydney Dickenson.\nAnd the hypothesis: regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: ``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.'' Jean smiled. He might have known that even someone as sensible as Miss van Wiliamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort.\nAnd the hypothesis: even someone as sensible as Miss van Williamsburgh would try to make a play of this sort\nentailment\nBased on the information: Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.  But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue. And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: contradiction\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long.\nAnd the hypothesis: it was too long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.\nAnd the hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it.\nAnd the hypothesis: she really enjoys it\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better\nAnd the hypothesis: it could be better\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.\nAnd the hypothesis: that would be bad\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: I wish they'd put those, that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf. It came on after Doctor Who, on Saturday nights, here at least. A: Uh-huh. B: And it should, of course I li- really it was, I don't think they should show it during prime time,\nAnd considering the hypothesis: they should show it during prime time\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: Not entailed\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.\nAnd the hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.

Perhaps Alec noticed that I did not ridicule him as the others did.\nAnd the hypothesis: he did not ridicule Alec as the others did\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.\nAnd the hypothesis: Jed should ask\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: I had decided that I had to have a partial confidant at the school. One did not have to attend school meals with the boys over the week-end if one was off duty. And the only master who might have noticed I had been away was Meli himself but as it happened he 'd been in Athens.\nAnd considering the hypothesis: he had been away\nIs it entailed or not entailed?\nPrediction: The hypothesis is not entailed.\n\nPrompt 2: (0)\nGiven the premise: B: So am I. A: Are you, B: You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,\nAnd the hypothesis: it's kind of coming back around to that\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: Now see I.

Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.\nAnd the hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.\nAnd the hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request\nentailment\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out\nAnd the hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out\ncontradiction\n(3)\nGiven the premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.\nAnd the hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: I was angry with her for not saying anything, not doing anything. I still had a formless feeling that she understood me where my mother did not. Perhaps it was despair that made me believe there was one person in the world who might know that I was in despair.\nAnd the hypothesis: he was in despair\nentailment\nBased on the information: She would shake her head and deftly speak of other matters, though never about her father's past. Now, I knew some French.

Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong.\nAnd the hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh.

A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.\nAnd the hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long\ncontradiction\n(1)\nGiven the premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with\nAnd the hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with\ncontradiction\n(2)\nGiven the premise: B: when you've lost something or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and you know, what you have and what you don't have. A: Yeah I agree. B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat?\nAnd the hypothesis: they're a security threat\nneutral\n(3)\nGiven the premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah.

I don't think they would have done that.\nAnd the hypothesis: they would have done that\ncontradiction\n(4)\nGiven the premise: A: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes B: Yes. A: you know, it's not just a matter um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder um, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. B: I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on.\nAnd the hypothesis: they educate the jurors enough to really know what's going on\ncontradiction\nBased on the information: B: And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation. And, of course, that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's, you render unto God what is God's. A: Right.

But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.\nAnd the hypothesis: Everett was missing\nentailment\n(1)\nGiven the premise: ``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.''

Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?\nAnd the hypothesis: they had no way of paying\nentailment\n(4)\nGiven the premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde.
